# Open Knowledge

Open Knowledge is a Decentralized LMS powered by Lighthouse, Filecoin and FVM.

#Description

Are you a protocol looking to host your content?
Are you a developer looking to find meaningful and structured content in the web3 space?

Then, Open Knowledge is your go-to decentralized LMS.
A seamless experience for both protocols and web3 curious to learn, grow and share content.

Open Knowledge is a Decentralized LMS powered by Lighthouse, Filecoin and FVM. Content creators can upload their content in the form of courses and learners can follow the course work to collect points.

# How it's made

We have used ReactJS for front end, Lighthouse for storage (encrypted) and FEVM(Hyperspace Testnet) for deploying the contracts.

The FE interacts with storage and the blockchain to store and retrieve content. The idea to use FEVM contracts is to eventually be able to renew the storage deals using SCs.
